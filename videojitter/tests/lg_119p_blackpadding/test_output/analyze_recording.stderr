Kept 7191 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.0585 or below ~-0.0585. First edge is right after sample 1443 (0.36075 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241341 (60.33525 seconds).
WARNING: the first and last edges are both falling. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
