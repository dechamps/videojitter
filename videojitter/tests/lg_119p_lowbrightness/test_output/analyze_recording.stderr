Kept 7193 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.0477 or below ~-0.0477. First edge is right after sample 1200 (0.3 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241178 (60.2945 seconds).
WARNING: the first and last edges are both rising. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
