Upsampling recording by 2x (to 4000.0 Hz)
Kept 1440 edges whose amplitude is above ~0.0554 or below ~-0.0654. First edge is right after sample 1016 (0.254 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241236 (60.309 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.917/~0.766
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
