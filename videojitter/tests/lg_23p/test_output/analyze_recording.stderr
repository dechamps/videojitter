431nth steepest slope is ~0.00269 (rising edges) / ~-0.01 (falling edges). Kept 1440 edges whose slope is above ~0.00135 or below ~-0.005. First edge is right after sample 855 (0.21375 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241077 (60.26925 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.916/~0.73
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
