Successfully loaded spec file containing 7192 frame transitions at 119.88011988011988 FPS
Recording analysis contains 7191 frame transitions, with first transition at ~15.558842 seconds and last transition at ~75.557263 seconds for a total of ~59.998421 seconds
WARNING: transition data contains 1 transitions where the previous transition is to the same color. This usually means the analyzer failed to make sense of some of the recording. These transitions will be reported as "invalid".
WARNING: number of recorded transitions is inconsistent with the spec. Either the recording is corrupted, or the video player skipped/duplicate some transitions entirely. This makes it difficult to figure out which transitions were intentionally delayed, and as such those may be incorrectly annotated.
Valid, non-delayed transition interval standard deviation: ~0.000012 seconds
