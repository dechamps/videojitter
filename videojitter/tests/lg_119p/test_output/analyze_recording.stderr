2158nth steepest slope is ~0.0049 (rising edges) / ~-0.00705 (falling edges). Kept 7193 edges whose slope is above ~0.00245 or below ~-0.00352. First edge is right after sample 175 (0.04375 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240221 (60.05525 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.826/~0.789
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
