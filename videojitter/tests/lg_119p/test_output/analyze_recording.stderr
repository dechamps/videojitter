Kept 7193 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.00625 or below ~-0.00625. First edge is right after sample 244 (0.061 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240222 (60.0555 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.61/~82.5
WARNING: the first and last edges are both falling. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
