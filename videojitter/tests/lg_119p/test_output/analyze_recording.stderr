Kept 7195 edges whose amplitude is above ~0.0189 or below ~-0.0101. First edge is right after sample 111 (0.02775 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240221 (60.05525 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.00465/~0.789
WARNING: the first and last edges are both rising. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
