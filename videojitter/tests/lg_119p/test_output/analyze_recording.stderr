Kept 7192 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.01 or below ~-0.01. First edge is right after sample 244 (0.061 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240147 (60.03675 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.61/~9.57
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
