2158nth steepest slope is ~0.00458 (rising edges) / ~-0.00796 (falling edges). Kept 7194 edges whose slope is above ~0.00229 or below ~-0.00398. First edge is right after sample 172 (0.043 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240222 (60.0555 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.655/~0.865
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
