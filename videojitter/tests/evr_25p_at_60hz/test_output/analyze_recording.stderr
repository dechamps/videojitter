450nth steepest slope is ~0.00431 (rising edges) / ~-0.00608 (falling edges). Kept 1502 edges whose slope is above ~0.00216 or below ~-0.00304. First edge is right after sample 1012 (0.253 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241342 (60.3355 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.893/~0.644
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
