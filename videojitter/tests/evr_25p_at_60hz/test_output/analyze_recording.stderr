Upsampling recording by 2x (to 4000.0 Hz)
Kept 1500 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.216 or below ~-0.216. First edge is right after sample 1285 (0.32125 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240999 (60.24975 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.02/~1.07
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
