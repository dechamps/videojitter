Test signal appears to start at sample 19751 (9.8755 seconds) and end at sample 140975 (70.4875 seconds) in the recording.

Kept 1499 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.0102 or below ~-0.0102. First edge is right after sample 1282 (0.3205 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241007 (60.25175 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~7.44/~1.62
WARNING: the first and last edges are both falling. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
