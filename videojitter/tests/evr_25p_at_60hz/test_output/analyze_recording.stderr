Kept 1500 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.00638 or below ~-0.00638. First edge is right after sample 1282 (0.3205 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241007 (60.25175 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~7.44/~1.62
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
