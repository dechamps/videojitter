450nth steepest slope is ~0.00254 (rising edges) / ~-0.0039 (falling edges). Kept 1502 edges whose slope is above ~0.00127 or below ~-0.00195. First edge is right after sample 1016 (0.254 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241345 (60.33625 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.871/~0.525
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
