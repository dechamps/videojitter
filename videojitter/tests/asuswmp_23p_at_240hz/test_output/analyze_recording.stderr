431nth steepest slope is ~0.00263 (rising edges) / ~-0.0158 (falling edges). Kept 1440 edges whose slope is above ~0.00132 or below ~-0.0079. First edge is right after sample 1022 (0.2555 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241344 (60.336 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.883/~0.533
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
