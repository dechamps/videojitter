Kept 3287 edges whose amplitude is above ~0.00859 or below ~-0.00914. First edge is right after sample 399 (0.09975 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240465 (60.11625 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.533/~0.975
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
