1079nth steepest slope is ~0.000874 (rising edges) / ~-0.00189 (falling edges). Kept 4336 edges whose slope is above ~0.000437 or below ~-0.000943. First edge is right after sample 6 (0.0015 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240870 (60.2175 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.07/~1.25
WARNING: the first and last edges are both rising. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
