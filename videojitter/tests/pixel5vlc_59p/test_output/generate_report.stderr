Successfully loaded spec file containing 3596 frame transitions at 59.94005994005994 FPS
Recording analysis contains 4625 frame transitions, with first transition at ~6.396202 seconds and last transition at ~66.612196 seconds for a total of ~60.215994 seconds
WARNING: transition data contains 196 transitions where the previous transition is to the same color. This usually means the analyzer failed to make sense of some of the recording. These transitions will be reported as "invalid".
WARNING: number of recorded transitions is inconsistent with the spec. Either the recording is corrupted, or the video player skipped/duplicate some transitions entirely. This makes it difficult to figure out which transitions were intentionally delayed, and as such those may be incorrectly annotated.
Valid, non-delayed transition interval standard deviation: ~0.009913 seconds
