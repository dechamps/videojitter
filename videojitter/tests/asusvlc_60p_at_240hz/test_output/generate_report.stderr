Recording analysis contains 3601 frame transitions, with first transition at ~6.070154 seconds and last transition at ~66.088711 seconds for a total of ~60.018557 seconds
WARNING: number of recorded transitions is inconsistent with the spec. Either the recording is corrupted, or the video player skipped/duplicate some transitions entirely. This makes it difficult to figure out which transitions were intentionally delayed, and as such those may be incorrectly annotated.
Valid, non-delayed transition interval standard deviation: ~0.002054 seconds
