Successfully loaded spec file containing 3600 frame transitions at 60.0 FPS
Recording analysis contains 3602 frame transitions, with first transition at ~6.070292 seconds and last transition at ~66.105081 seconds for a total of ~60.034790 seconds
WARNING: data contains 1 edges where the previous edge is the same direction (i.e. transition from one color to the same color). This usually means the analyzer failed to make sense of some of the recording. These transitions will be reported as "invalid".
Deduced from delayed transitions that rising edges are transitions to black and falling edges are transitions to white
Valid, non-delayed transition interval standard deviation: ~0.002313 seconds
