1080nth steepest slope is ~0.00283 (rising edges) / ~-0.0177 (falling edges). Kept 3602 edges whose slope is above ~0.00141 or below ~-0.00883. First edge is right after sample 337 (0.08425 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240476 (60.119 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.887/~0.537
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
