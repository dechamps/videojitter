Kept 3600 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.157 or below ~-0.157. First edge is right after sample 488 (0.122 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240324 (60.081 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~3.99/~3.3
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
