Test signal appears to start at sample 11971 (5.9855 seconds) and end at sample 132380 (66.19 seconds) in the recording.
Upsampling recording by 2x (to 4000.0 Hz)
Kept 3603 edges whose amplitude is above ~0.0481 or below ~-0.0323. First edge is right after sample 238 (0.0595 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240479 (60.11975 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.0165/~0.528
WARNING: the first and last edges are both rising. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
