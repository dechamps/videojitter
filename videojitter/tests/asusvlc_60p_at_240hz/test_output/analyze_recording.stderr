1080nth steepest slope is ~0.00325 (rising edges) / ~-0.0186 (falling edges). Kept 3602 edges whose slope is above ~0.00162 or below ~-0.00932. First edge is right after sample 338 (0.0845 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240479 (60.11975 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.905/~0.528
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
