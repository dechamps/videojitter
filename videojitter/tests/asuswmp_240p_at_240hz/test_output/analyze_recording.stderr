4320nth steepest slope is ~0.000713 (rising edges) / ~-0.00157 (falling edges). Kept 14393 edges whose slope is above ~0.000357 or below ~-0.000787. First edge is right after sample 1 (0.00025 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240034 (60.0085 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.667/~1.19
First edge is rising and last edge is falling. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to black and a rising edge means a transition to white.
