Kept 14394 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.00131 or below ~-0.00131. First edge is right after sample 40 (0.01 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240068 (60.017 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~2.61/~2.23
First edge is rising and last edge is falling. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to black and a rising edge means a transition to white.
