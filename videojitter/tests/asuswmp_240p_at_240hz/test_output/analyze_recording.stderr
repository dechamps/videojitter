Kept 14392 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.00666 or below ~-0.00666. First edge is right after sample 68 (0.017 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240034 (60.0085 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.11/~1.01
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
