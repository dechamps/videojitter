1080nth steepest slope is ~0.00271 (rising edges) / ~-0.0171 (falling edges). Kept 3601 edges whose slope is above ~0.00135 or below ~-0.00853. First edge is right after sample 352 (0.088 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240426 (60.1065 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.18/~0.942
First edge is rising and last edge is falling. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to black and a rising edge means a transition to white.
