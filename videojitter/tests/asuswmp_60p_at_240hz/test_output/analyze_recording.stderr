Test signal appears to start at sample 11271 (5.6355 seconds) and end at sample 131743 (65.8715 seconds) in the recording.
Upsampling recording by 2x (to 4000.0 Hz)
Kept 3599 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.0185 or below ~-0.0185. First edge is right after sample 551 (0.13775 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240401 (60.10025 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~3.18/~5.78
WARNING: the first and last edges are both falling. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
