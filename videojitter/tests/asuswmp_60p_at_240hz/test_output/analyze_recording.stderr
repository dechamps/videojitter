Kept 3600 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.0116 or below ~-0.0116. First edge is right after sample 551 (0.13775 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240401 (60.10025 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~3.18/~5.78
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
