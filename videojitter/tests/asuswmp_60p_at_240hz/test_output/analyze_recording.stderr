Test signal appears to start at sample 11271 (5.6355 seconds) and end at sample 131743 (65.8715 seconds) in the recording.
Upsampling recording by 2x (to 4000.0 Hz)
Kept 3602 edges whose amplitude is above ~0.0474 or below ~-0.0314. First edge is right after sample 411 (0.10275 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240539 (60.13475 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.11/~0.511
WARNING: the first and last edges are both rising. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
