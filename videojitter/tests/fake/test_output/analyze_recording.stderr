Upsampling recording by 2x (to 4000.0 Hz)
Kept 1440 edges whose amplitude is above ~0.333 or below ~-0.334. First edge is right after sample 835 (0.20875 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 253717 (63.42925 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.823/~0.504
First edge is rising and last edge is falling. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to black and a rising edge means a transition to white.
