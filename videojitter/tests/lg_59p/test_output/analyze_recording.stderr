Kept 3598 edges whose amplitude is above ~0.0458 or below ~-0.0337. First edge is right after sample 351 (0.08775 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240457 (60.11425 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.907/~0.732
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
