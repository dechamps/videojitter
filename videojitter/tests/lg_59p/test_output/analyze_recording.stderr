Kept 3595 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.0148 or below ~-0.0148. First edge is right after sample 482 (0.1205 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240320 (60.08 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.18/~1.3
WARNING: the first and last edges are both falling. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
