Recording analysis contains 1438 frame transitions, with first transition at ~6.401508 seconds and last transition at ~66.379802 seconds for a total of ~59.978294 seconds
WARNING: data contains 1 edges where the previous edge is the same direction (i.e. transition from one color to the same color). This usually means the analyzer failed to make sense of some of the recording. These transitions will be reported as "invalid".
Deduced from delayed transitions that rising edges are transitions to black and falling edges are transitions to white
Valid, non-delayed transition interval standard deviation: ~0.007807 seconds
