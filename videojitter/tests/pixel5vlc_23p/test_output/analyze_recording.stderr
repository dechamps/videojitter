Kept 1436 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.0625 or below ~-0.0625. First edge is right after sample 1164 (0.291 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240745 (60.18625 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~4.02/~2.2
First edge is rising and last edge is falling. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to black and a rising edge means a transition to white.
