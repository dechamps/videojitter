431nth steepest slope is ~0.00116 (rising edges) / ~-0.00146 (falling edges). Kept 5905 edges whose slope is above ~0.000582 or below ~-0.000728. First edge is right after sample 280 (0.07 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241754 (60.4385 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.954/~1.02
WARNING: the first and last edges are both rising. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
