Test signal appears to start at sample 12204 (6.102 seconds) and end at sample 133341 (66.6705 seconds) in the recording.
Upsampling recording by 2x (to 4000.0 Hz)
Kept 1436 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.0625 or below ~-0.0625. First edge is right after sample 1332 (0.333 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240913 (60.22825 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.0/~0.94
WARNING: the first and last edges are both rising. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
