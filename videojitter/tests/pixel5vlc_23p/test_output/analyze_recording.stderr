Kept 1436 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.0625 or below ~-0.0625. First edge is right after sample 1164 (0.291 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240745 (60.18625 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.0/~0.939
WARNING: the first and last edges are both rising. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
