431nth steepest slope is ~0.00142 (rising edges) / ~-0.00126 (falling edges). Kept 1432 edges whose slope is above ~0.000712 or below ~-0.000629. First edge is right after sample 573 (0.14325 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241814 (60.4535 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.558/~1.12
WARNING: the first and last edges are both falling. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
