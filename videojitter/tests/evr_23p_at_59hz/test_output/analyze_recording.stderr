Test signal appears to start at sample 24796 (12.398 seconds) and end at sample 145748 (72.874 seconds) in the recording.
Upsampling recording by 2x (to 4000.0 Hz)
Kept 1441 edges whose amplitude is above ~0.0472 or below ~-0.0449. First edge is right after sample 757 (0.18925 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241236 (60.309 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.00175/~0.66
WARNING: the first and last edges are both rising. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
