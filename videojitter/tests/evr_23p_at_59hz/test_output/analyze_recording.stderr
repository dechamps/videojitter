431nth steepest slope is ~0.00442 (rising edges) / ~-0.0061 (falling edges). Kept 1440 edges whose slope is above ~0.00221 or below ~-0.00305. First edge is right after sample 1001 (0.25025 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241236 (60.309 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.822/~0.66
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
