431nth steepest slope is ~0.00251 (rising edges) / ~-0.00389 (falling edges). Kept 1440 edges whose slope is above ~0.00126 or below ~-0.00194. First edge is right after sample 997 (0.24925 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241231 (60.30775 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.851/~0.545
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
