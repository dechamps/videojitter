Kept 1437 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.145 or below ~-0.145. First edge is right after sample 1013 (0.25325 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 253203 (63.30075 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.18/~1.03
WARNING: the first and last edges are both rising. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
