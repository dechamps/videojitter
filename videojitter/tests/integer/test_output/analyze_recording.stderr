431nth steepest slope is ~0.0636 (rising edges) / ~-0.061 (falling edges). Kept 1439 edges whose slope is above ~0.0318 or below ~-0.0305. First edge is right after sample 835 (0.20875 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 253551 (63.38775 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.823/~1.05
First edge is rising and last edge is falling. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to black and a rising edge means a transition to white.
