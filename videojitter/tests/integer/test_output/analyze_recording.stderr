Kept 1436 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~1.33 or below ~-1.33. First edge is right after sample 1364 (0.341 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 253203 (63.30075 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.12/~0.973
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
