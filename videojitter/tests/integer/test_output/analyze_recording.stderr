431nth steepest slope is ~0.0783 (rising edges) / ~-0.0788 (falling edges). Kept 1439 edges whose slope is above ~0.0392 or below ~-0.0394. First edge is right after sample 152 (0.038 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 252860 (63.215 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.07/~0.603
First edge is rising and last edge is falling. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to black and a rising edge means a transition to white.
