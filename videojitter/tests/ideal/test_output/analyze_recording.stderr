431nth steepest slope is ~0.45 (rising edges) / ~-0.45 (falling edges). Kept 1438 edges whose slope is above ~0.225 or below ~-0.225. First edge is right after sample 1006 (0.2515 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240913 (60.22825 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.05/~1.04
First edge is rising and last edge is falling. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to black and a rising edge means a transition to white.
