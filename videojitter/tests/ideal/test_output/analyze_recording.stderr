Kept 1436 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~2.51 or below ~-2.51. First edge is right after sample 1341 (0.33525 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240579 (60.14475 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~2.77/~3.1
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
