431nth steepest slope is ~0.00442 (rising edges) / ~-0.00611 (falling edges). Kept 1440 edges whose slope is above ~0.00221 or below ~-0.00306. First edge is right after sample 560 (0.14 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240824 (60.206 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.694/~0.658
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
