Kept 1437 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.0155 or below ~-0.0155. First edge is right after sample 1342 (0.3355 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240952 (60.238 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~1.12/~0.998
WARNING: the first and last edges are both falling. This doesn't make sense as the first and last frames of the test video are supposed to be both black. Unable to determine transition directions as a result.
