Kept 1440 edges whose amplitude is above ~0.0539 or below ~-0.0649. First edge is right after sample 1013 (0.25325 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241287 (60.32175 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.875/~0.629
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
