431nth steepest slope is ~0.00268 (rising edges) / ~-0.00873 (falling edges). Kept 1440 edges whose slope is above ~0.00134 or below ~-0.00436. First edge is right after sample 1011 (0.25275 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241285 (60.32125 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.886/~0.539
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
