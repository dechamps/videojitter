Kept 1438 slope peaks whose prominence is above ~0.00637 or below ~-0.00637. First edge is right after sample 1334 (0.3335 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 240897 (60.22425 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~3.0/~1.05
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
