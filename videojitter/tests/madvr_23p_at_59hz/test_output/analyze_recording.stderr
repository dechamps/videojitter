431nth steepest slope is ~0.00441 (rising edges) / ~-0.00605 (falling edges). Kept 1440 edges whose slope is above ~0.0022 or below ~-0.00303. First edge is right after sample 1001 (0.25025 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241237 (60.30925 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.888/~0.735
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
