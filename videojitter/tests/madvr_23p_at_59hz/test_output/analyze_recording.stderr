431nth steepest slope is ~0.0025 (rising edges) / ~-0.0039 (falling edges). Kept 1440 edges whose slope is above ~0.00125 or below ~-0.00195. First edge is right after sample 997 (0.24925 seconds) and last edge is right after sample 241232 (60.308 seconds).
First/last edge slopes relative to neighbors min: ~0.85/~0.541
First edge is falling and last edge is rising. Deducing that a falling edge means a transition to white and a rising edge means a transition to black.
