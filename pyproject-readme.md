# videojitter - the video cadence measurement toolbox

_"You don't have to trust your eyes anymore"_

videojitter is a set of command line tools for **accurate measurement of frame
presentation timing in a video playback system**. It can be used to detect and
quantify issues such as:

- **Frames being displayed too early or too late**
- **Dropped frames**
- **Repeated frames**
- **Periodic patterns** such as 3:2 "24p@60Hz"
- **Sudden changes** in presentation cadence
- Video **clock jitter**
- Video **clock skew**
- etc.
